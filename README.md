Mark Stephen Sobkow's Licenses

This repository contains all the license texts used
for the MSS Code Factory source code whether public,
shared, dual licensed, or pure open source.

The presence of a given license file in a source code
directory by no means implies that it applies to all code
files in that directory; you have to check each individual
file for the license that applies to it.
